# Shakespearean Echo: Text Generation with LSTM  

This repository contains a deep learning project that generates text resembling Shakespeare's writing using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.  

---

## Project Overview  

The goal is to train a model that predicts the next word in a sequence, generating coherent text in the style of Shakespeare. While the model captures linguistic patterns effectively, it encounters overfitting issues, leading to repeated phrases after generating 60â€“65 words.  

---

## Features  

- **Text Tokenization:** Converts text into numerical sequences using tokenization and padding.  
- **Model Architecture:** Embedding layer, stacked LSTM layers, and a Dense output layer with softmax activation.  
- **Training with Batch Processing:** Uses data generators to enhance generalization.  
- **Text Generation Demo:** Generates text based on seed phrases in Shakespeare's style.

## Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shakespearean-echo.git  
   cd shakespearean-echo  
   ```  
2. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

---

## Usage  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
Prepare Shakespeare's text for training by tokenizing and padding sequences.  

### 2. Model Training  
Train the LSTM-based model:  
```bash  
python train_model.py  
```  

### 3. Generate Text  
Use the trained model to generate Shakespearean-style text:  
```bash  
python generate_text.py  
```

## Example Output  

Input Seed:  
```
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day"  
```  

Generated Text:  
```
Shall I be gone go on me if I do I see thee slave to you as I have...  
```

## Limitations  

- Overfitting leads to repeated phrases after ~60 words.  
- Limited vocabulary affects text creativity.  

---

## Future Work  

- Implement alternative architectures like GRU or Transformers.  
- Use dropout and regularization for better generalization.
